    <br />
    So glad to have you join us in this 3-part interview series where I get to chat with none other than the great saxophonist, <strong>David Liebman</strong>.<br />
    <br />
    First off, if you&#39;re not familiar with David&#39;s playing, I can tell you that he is truly one of today&#39;s living legends, having recorded over 500 albums, and performed with fellow jazz legends including Miles Davis, Chick Corea, Elvin Jones, and many, many others. His bio can be found below, but I just wanted to get that bit out of the way.&nbsp; &nbsp;

    <br><strong>NEA Jazz Master (2011)</strong> David Liebman&rsquo;s career has spanned nearly five decades, beginning in the early 1970s as the saxophone/flautist in both the <strong>Elvin Jones</strong> and <strong>Miles Davis</strong> groups, as well as tours and recordings with the likes of <strong>Chick Corea, John McLaughlin, McCoy Tyner </strong>and countless others. He has played on <strong>over five hundred recordings</strong> with <strong>nearly two hundred under his leadership</strong> and co-leadership.<br>
