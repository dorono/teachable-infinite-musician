<h2>A Creatively-Rewarding "Workout"</h2>
<p>The vignettes are written to be interpreted <strong>in a range of styles</strong>, and function as etudes in that many <strong>focus on particular challenges or skills</strong>, including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>circular breathing</li>
  <li>altissimo</li>
  <li>odd time signatures</li>
  <li>overtones</li>
  <li>speed</li>
  <li>flexibility</li>
  <li>articulation</li>
  <li>syncopation</li>
  <li>endurance</li>
  <li>dynamic contrast</li>
  <li>melodic patterns</li>
</ul>
<p>While written on the alto, the vignettes can be performed on <strong><em>all</em> saxophones</strong>.
</p>
<p>They are intended for the advanced player, but can also be highly effective for the ambitious mid-level player.

<h2>Much More Than Just an Ebook</h2>
<p>As mentioned previously, with this exclusive video master class edition of <em>Vignettes</em>, we've taken what started out as an ebook, and turned it into a comprehensive course of study. In fact, because the wide array of challenges that this collection offers, <strong>this program could serve as the bulk of a practice routine.</strong>
