<h2>Recital-Ready Practice Material
</h2>
<p>This collection was <strong>commissioned by a consortium of world-class saxophone performers and educators</strong> who tasked Remy with the challenge of creating music that would serve not only as <strong>highly effective practice material</strong>, but also as a set of compositions rich and compelling enough to <strong>stand on their own as concert and recital repertoire</strong>.
