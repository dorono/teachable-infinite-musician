        <h3>Demonstration and Backing Tracks</h3>
        <ul class="features-list">
          <li>
            For each etude, there's a recording of me playing the piece over a
            backing track to
            <strong>eliminate any guesswork</strong> when it comes to knowing
            exactly what the “end result” is supposed to sound like.
          </li>
          <li>
            After 1 chorus of me demonstrating, the track
            <strong>continues with just the rhythm section</strong> so you can
            <strong><em>soar off</em> into your own solo</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each tune is also accompanied by the
            <strong>backing track in the demonstration</strong>.
          </li>
