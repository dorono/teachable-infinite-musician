  The first release, published in 2017. A unique approach to scale/interval
  practice, Bach Shapes is the music of J.S. Bach distilled to its basic
  elements: beautiful melodic shapes. These can be studied as technical
  exercises, or used as building blocks for jazz improvisation. Suitable for any
  instrument and currently being used by guitarists, oboists, clarinetists and
  more. The studies are drawn from Bachâ€™s violin, cello, flute and keyboard
  music and ordered by difficulty, transposed into all keys. Learn to stretch
  your range and play intervals more evenly with these musical studies. At the
  end are four etudes based on jazz standards. The cover and interior has been
  beautifully designed by Chrissy Kurpeski.
