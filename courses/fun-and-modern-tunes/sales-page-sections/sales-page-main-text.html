<!--<p>The saxophone is one of, if not the most exciting, expressive, emotionally engaging, and beloved instruments in the world.</p>-->
<p>
  Whatever music it was that first sparked you or your child’s interest in the
  sax, chances are that
  <strong>it wasn’t simplistic nursery rhymes or boring exercises.</strong>
</p>
<h3>
  Unfortunately, these types of tunes are precisely what you find in the vast
  majority of beginner saxophone practice books.
</h3>
<p>
  While it may seem that these types of songs are necessary for learning the
  basics of the instrument, they’re actually <em>slowing down</em> you or your
  child’s progress.
</p>
<p>
  After decades spent taking students of all ages from beginners to outstanding
  players, I can tell you one thing for sure…
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    ><em
      >Playing music that excites and inspires you is the faster way to build
      foundational skills.</em

<h3>Striking a Balance Between Fundamentals and Fun</h3>
<p>
  At the end of the day, the primary goal of a beginning saxophonist practice
  book is to get you:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Fluent with the fingerings</strong> for all the notes on the
    instrument
  </li>
  <li><strong>Reading</strong> music</li>
  <li>Strengthening the <strong>embouchure</strong></li>
  <li>
    Improving <strong>articulation</strong> and use of <strong>dynamics</strong>
  </li>
  <li>Developing understanding of <strong>rhythm</strong></li>
  <li>Using techniques such as <strong>trills and tremolos</strong></li>
  <li>Learning basic <strong>music theory</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>
  But none of that is going to happen if practicing starts
  <strong>feeling like a chore</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  And likewise, the <strong>discouragement</strong> that comes from attempting
  to tackle music that’s not suited towards beginners is also going to
  <strong>stop progress dead in its track</strong>s.
</p>
<h3>A New Pathway to Sounding Great Sooner and Staying Motivated</h3>
<p>
  After seeing that the books typically found at the top of a search on
  Amazon.com were driving many students into that
  <strong>proverbial wall of <em>de-</em>motivation</strong>, I developed my own
  program of learning material that would:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Teach <em><strong>ALL of the fundamentals</strong></em> found in the
    top-selling beginner sax books
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide <strong>unmistakably superior outcomes</strong> by harnessing the
    <strong>passion and excitemen</strong>t that first drew the student to the
    instrument
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Based on the <strong>incredible success of this approach</strong>, I created
  <em>Fun and Modern Tunes for Beginner Saxophonists</em>.
</p>
<p>Far <strong>more than just a practice book</strong>, this program is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>An ebook of 25 songs</strong>, with each song written in a modern
    style of music that’s <strong>rarely, if <em>ever</em>,</strong> included in
    a saxophone method book for beginners.
  </li>
  <li>
    An accompanying set of <strong>backing tracks for each song</strong>, with
    each track transposed to make it easy to play along - regardless of whether
    you play <strong>alto, tenor, baritone, or soprano sax</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Demonstration tracks</strong> for each song with me playing each
    tune over the backing track to <strong>eliminate any guesswork</strong> when
    it comes to knowing exactly what the “end result” is supposed to sound like.
  </li>
</ul>
