                    <strong>SAMPLE ANALYSIS</strong>
                </p>
                <p>This etude makes extensive use of a cycle of major/dominant chords that start on the flat-six of the
                    key. They progress around the circle of fourths until the cycle resolves in measure five.</p>

                <p>Measures 1-2:
                    <br>The opening two measures are diatonic and consist of inverted triad shapes.
                </p>

                <p>Measure 5:
                    <br>This measure references the motif played in measures 1 and 2.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Measure 9-12:
                    <br>
                    These measures constitute the cycle of chord changes (V7 to I), starting on the flat-six,
                    progressing around the circle of fourths. These four bars are also an example of melodic sequencing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Measures 17-24:
                    <br>
                    These measures are a long melodic sequence that is built upon descending arpeggio shapes, diatonic
                    to the chords they are played over. Measures 23 and 24 use the sound of tri-tone substitution.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Measures 25-28:
                    <br>
                    Yet another example of the cycle of chord changes (V7 to I), starting on the flat-six, progressing
                    around the circle of fourths. Measures 26-28 are another example of melodic sequencing.

                        For each etude, there's a recording of me playing the piece over a
                        backing track to
                        <strong>eliminate any guesswork</strong> when it comes to knowing
                        exactly what the “end result” is supposed to sound like.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After 1 chorus of me demonstrating, the track
                        <strong>continues with just the rhythm section</strong> so you can
                        <strong><em>soar off</em> into your own solo</strong>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each tune is also accompanied by the
                        <strong>backing track in the demonstration</strong>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
