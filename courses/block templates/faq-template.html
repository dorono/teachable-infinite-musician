    <p>What level saxophonist is this program designed for?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>
      <strong></strong>Saxophonists at <em><strong>any level</strong></em> would
      benefit from this course. So many of us have had to waste precious time
      going back and re-learning the basics due to poor habits instilled by a
      well-meaning band director, neighborhood sax teacher, or sub-par online
      video. So if you’re an absolute beginner, you’re very likely to find
      yourself improving in the quickest and most efficient way possible. And if
      you’re super-advanced, David dives so deep into the art of saxophone sound
      that
      <strong
        >it would be pretty unlikely that you’d dig into the materials and say
        to yourself, </strong
      ><em><strong>“yep, already mastered all of this.”</strong> </em>So no
      matter your level, if you <em>take action,</em> there is no way that you
      are not going to see major results.

    <p>Can't I just get all of this stuff for free on Youtube?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>
      The short answer is, <strong>no way</strong>. There are few (if any)
      teachers who can take you as deep into the art of sax sound like David
      Liebman. So any course of study that you'd assemble from Google-searching
      for free online videos will not come anywhere near the level of depth and
      accuracy that you’ll find from absorbing all of this time-tested
      information,
      <strong>laid out in a structured, step-by-step, “A-to-Z” format</strong>
      like what's being offered here.

    <p>How long do I have access to the course?</p>

  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>
      How does <strong>lifetime</strong> access sound? After enrolling, you have
      unlimited access to this course for as long as you like (that means
      <em>no recurring subscription fees</em>) - across any and all devices you
      own.
