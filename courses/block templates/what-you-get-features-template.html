    Here's a collection of 30 1-bar exercises meant to be "looped" - sort of
    like a super-hip broken record. But seriously, since having fresh practice
    material is a huge part of your musical success, here's another set of
    challenging (but very doable at the right tempo) and fun exercises to keep
    you inspired and improving.
    <br />
  </p>
  <ul class="features-list">
    <li>
      You'll move through unique patterns that will force you into melodies and
      intervallic shapes you'd almost certainly never arrive at otherwise.
    </li>
    <li>
      Each loop offers a killer 1-measure warmup
      <em>(that's likely to be more helpful than just running scales)</em>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Like <em>Bach Shapes</em>, these exercises are ordered from easiest to
      most challenging, which gives you those "quick wins" that propel you to
      the next exercise.
