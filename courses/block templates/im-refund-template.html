  Our attitude is that if for whatever reason you aren’t happy with
  <em>Bach Shapes</em>, just let us know and we’ll immediately credit you 100%
  of the book's purchase price towards any of the courses on
  InfiniteMusician.com (since out of fairness to the author, we cannot offer a
  refund on a downloadable product) - <strong>no questions asked</strong>. We
  strongly believe that applying the information in this book will make a major
  impact on your playing, but
  <strong
    >the most important thing to us is that you’re happy with your
    purchase</strong
  >
  .
</p>
<p>
  And since we know that life happens and you might not get a chance to dive
  deep into the material right after you get it, we'll credit you at
  <strong>any time, </strong
  ><em>no matter how long ago you picked up this book</em>.
