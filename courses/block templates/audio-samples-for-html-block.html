        <h3>Demonstration and Backing Tracks</h3>
        <p>
          All audio tracks are transposed to make it easy to play along -
          regardless of whether you play
          <strong>alto, tenor, baritone, or soprano sax</strong>
        </p>
        <h4>Demonstration Track Examples</h4>
        <ul class="features-list">
          <li>
            For each song, there's a recording of me playing each tune over a
            backing track to
            <strong>eliminate any guesswork</strong> when it comes to knowing
            exactly what the “end result” is supposed to sound like.
