<p>If you've made it all the way through all of the videos - let me first just say - <strong>CONGRATULATIONS!
    </strong>That is no small feat, since there is indeed a boatload of stuff we went through.
</p>
<p>So now the question arises - <strong><em>"how do I actually fit all of this in my practice routine in a way that's
            deliberate and results-oriented?"</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Well, I'm glad you asked - since here is the approach I've taken to mastering this content, and the pathway I'm
    laying out here definitely brought great results my way, and will do the same for you if you just stick with it and
    make mastery and fun the goal over any arbitrary deadline to master all of the lessons.
</p>
<h2>Phases
</h2>
<p>Rather than break down the steps in terms of time, I think it would be better to break it down in terms of content,
    so each phase here is to be completed on your own time table, depending on the time you have to practice as well as
    your experience level and skill.
</p>
<p>Below you will see different phases that include example instructions of how to practically integrate parts of the
    information that are found within this tutorial.
</p>
<p><strong>Regardless of your level of skill, you should not attempt to touch upon every exercise in this tutorial every
        day, or even every week.</strong> It will be much more
    practical for you to spend a portion of your practice time devoted to technique, focusing on one or
    more of the phases detailed below.
</p>
<p>Depending on your skill level and time allotment for the “technique” portion of your practice routine, the number
    of phases practiced each day will vary drastically.
</p>
<p>For continuity, I’ve done my best to divide all of the material below into the two primary ways that I think about
    the orientation of scales;
    <strong>horizontal</strong> and <strong>vertical</strong>.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Phase 1: Horizontal Aspects of Scales</h2>
<ul>
    <li>12 Major and Melodic Minor scales</li>
    <li>Strive to be able to play each scale in eighth notes at quarter note = 160, as a maximum tempo</li>
    <li>Start the metronome at the fastest tempo you can play nearly 100% cleanly, no matter how slow that is</li>
</ul>
<h2>Phase 2: Vertical Aspect of Scales</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Diatonic Intervals</li>
    <li>Begin with Diatonic Thirds. Once comfortable, move on to the next interval </li>
    <li>One direction per week (can be adjusted to be more directions based upon comprehension level) </li>
    <li>Three keys in Major and Melodic minor per week </li>
</ul>
<h2>Phase 3: Horizontal Aspect of Scales; Segmented</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Begin with four-note segments. Once comfortable, being to practice five, six, seven note segments, etc. </li>
    <li>One direction per week (can be adjusted to be more directions based upon comprehension level) </li>
    <li>Three keys in Major and Melodic minor per week</li>
</ul>
<h2>Phase 4: Vertical Aspect of Scales: Arpeggios </h2>
<ul>
    <li>Diatonic 7th arpeggios to Major scales</li>
    <li>3 keys in Major and Melodic minor per week</li>
    <li>Test knowledge of chord symbol and chord/scale relationship</li>
</ul>
<h2>Phase 5: Vertical Aspect of Scales: Creative approaches to 4th’s
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Stacked 4ths, diatonic to a major key</li>
    <li>3 keys per week</li>
    <li>One direction per week</li>
    <li>Infinity 4th’s diatonic to a major key</li>
    <li>3 keys per week</li>
</ul>
<h2>Phase 6: Horizontal Aspect of Scales via Vertical Implications
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Descending Major Scales by Ascending Diatonic 7th</li>
    <li>One Major Key per week</li>
    <li>Eventually moving on to all modes diatonic to that one key, per week</li>
</ul>
<h2>Phase 7: Horizontal Aspect of Scales via Vertical Implications, Adjusted
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Descending Major Scales by Ascending Diatonic 7th, down a scale step</li>
    <li>One Major Key per week</li>
    <li>Eventually moving on to all modes diatonic to that one key, per week</li>
</ul>
<h2>Phase 8: Horizontal Aspect of Scales via Vertical Implications, Integration
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Integration of Phase 6 over a ii-V7-I progression</li>
    <li>Small digital pattern (8-7-6-5) over each chord change</li>
    <li>Small digital pattern over ii-Tri-tone V7-I</li>
    <li>4 keys per week</li>
    <li>Apply over a standard that you might be working on</li>
</ul>
<h2>Phase 9: Horizontal Aspect of Scales via Vertical Implications, Adjusted, Integration
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Integration of Phase 7 over a ii-V7-I progression</li>
    <li>Small digital pattern (8-7-6-5) over each chord change</li>
    <li>Small digital pattern over ii-Tri-tone V7-I</li>
    <li>4 keys per week</li>
    <li>Apply over a standard that you might be working on</li>
</ul>
<h2>Phase 10: Creative approach to Arpeggios; “Inner/Outers” (Vertical Aspect of scales)
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3 keys per week</li>
    <li>1 Inner permutation per week</li>
    <li>1 outer permutation per week</li>
</ul>
<h2>Phase 11: Triad Pairs linked by whole step; Groups of 3’s
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3 pairs per week</li>
    <li>2 directions per week</li>
</ul>
<h2>Phase 12: Triad Paris linked by whole step: Groups of 4’s

    <li>2 directions per week</li>
</ul>
<h2>Phase13: Chromatic Scale Vertical Aspect
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Minor and Major 3rds, by minor 2nd’s</li>

    <li>2 directions per week</li>
</ul>

</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Full Range</li>
    <li>Ascending/Descending</li>
</ul>
