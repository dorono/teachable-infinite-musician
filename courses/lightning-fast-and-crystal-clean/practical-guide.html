<p>If you've made it all the way through all of the videos - let me first just say - <strong>CONGRATULATIONS!
    </strong>That is no small feat, since there is indeed a boatload of stuff we went through.
</p>
<p>So now the question arises - <strong><em>"how do I actually fit all of this in my practice routine in a way that's
            deliberate and results-oriented?"
        </em></strong>
</p>
<p>Well, I'm glad you asked - since here is the approach I've taken to mastering this content, and the pathway I'm
    laying out here definitely brought great results my way, and will do the same for you if you just stick with it and
    make mastery and fun the goal over any arbitrary deadline to master all of the lessons.
</p>
<h2>Phases</h2>
<p>Rather than break down the steps in terms of time, I think it would be better to break it down in terms of content,
    so each phase here is to be completed on your own time table, depending on the time you have to practice as well as
    your experience level and skill.
</p>
<p>Below you will see different phases with links to their associated video lessons, and in some cases, sheet music,
    along with some key points on how to practically integrate the phase into your practice routine.
</p>
<p><strong>Regardless of your level of skill, you should not attempt to touch upon every exercise in this course every
        day, or even every week.
    </strong> It will be much more practical for you to spend a portion of your practice
    time devoted to technique, focusing on one or more of the phases detailed below.
</p>
<p>Depending on your skill level and time allotment for the “technique” portion of your practice routine, the number of
    phases practiced each day will vary drastically.
</p>
<p>For continuity, I’ve done my best to divide all of the material below into the two primary ways that I think about
    the orientation of scales;
    <strong>horizontal</strong> and <strong>vertical</strong>.
</p>
<p>While the non-chromatic exercises (ie: all phases excluding 13 and 14) described below are based on the major scale
    and its associated chords, the ultimate goal
    would be to repeat this sequence of phases with the exercises adjusted for other scales and associated chords
    including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale#Natural_minor_scale" target="blank">natural minor</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale#Melodic_minor_scale" target="blank">melodic minor</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale#Harmonic_minor_scale" target="_blank">harmonic minor</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half_diminished_scale" target="_blank">half diminished</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octatonic_scale" target="_blank">diminished (aka octantonic)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Also keep in mind that this is just my suggested sequence of phases, but feel free modify the order of the phases if
    there are specific areas you want to tackle first, since the last thing I want to do is introduce rigity and zap the
    fun (and best possible results!) out of your technique practice.
